# EchoVaults Transparency Repository

> **"Your last word should be heard only when it truly matters, and by those who truly matter."**

## What is EchoVaults?

EchoVaults is a digital legacy application that allows you to securely store messages, documents, and media for your loved ones to access after you're gone. Unlike a traditional will or note, EchoVaults gives you **granular control** over who can see what, and when.

This repository contains the **complete security and privacy implementation** of EchoVaults, made open source to build trust through transparency.

## Why Open Source the Security Layer?

When dealing with life-and-death matters, **trust cannot be built on promises alone**. It must be built on **verifiable technology**.

### What You Can Verify:
- **Enhanced Encryption Implementation**: See exactly how your data is protected with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256
- **Privacy Controls**: Verify how the three privacy levels work
- **Access Logic**: Understand who can see what, and when
- **No Backdoors**: Confirm there are no hidden access methods
- **Local-Only Storage**: Verify data never leaves your device
- **Cross-Version Compatibility**: Ensure your existing data remains accessible

### What We Keep Proprietary:
- **User Interface**: Our design and user experience
- **Trademarked Name**: EchoVaults as brand

## Repository Contents

### Core Security Components

#### [`lib/encryption/core_encryption.dart`](lib/encryption/core_encryption.dart)
The heart of EchoVaults security with **enhanced cryptographic protection**. Contains:
- **AES-256 encryption** with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 key derivation
- **10,000 iteration PBKDF2** for brute-force resistance
- **Automatic salt generation** for each encryption operation
- **Key derivation caching** for performance optimization
- **Privacy-level specific encryption** (Basic, Sensitive, Ultra)
- **Cross-version compatibility** with automatic fallback
- **Password hashing and verification**

```dart
// Example: Enhanced Ultra vault encryption with PBKDF2 (owner-only)
final encrypted = await CoreEncryptionService.encryptText(content, masterPassword);

// Example: Basic vault encoding (accessible to trusted persons)
final encoded = CoreEncryptionService.encryptTextForBasicVault(content, masterPassword);

// Example: Binary file encryption with optimized format
final encryptedFile = await CoreEncryptionService.encryptBinaryData(fileData, masterPassword);
```

#### [`lib/security/privacy_levels.dart`](lib/security/privacy_levels.dart)
Implements the three-tier privacy system:
- **ðŸŸ¢ Basic**: Immediate access after security questions
- **ðŸŸ¡ Sensitive**: Delayed access (configurable: hours to years)
- **ðŸ”´ Ultra**: Owner-only, never accessible to trusted persons

#### [`lib/security/security_questions.dart`](lib/security/security_questions.dart)
Security questions validation logic:
- **Exact matching** (case-sensitive, no fuzzy matching)
- **All questions required** (no partial success)
- **Integrity verification** without breaking emergency access

#### [`lib/validation/file_validation.dart`](lib/validation/file_validation.dart)
File attachment security:
- **Local storage only** (no cloud uploads)
- **File type validation** and content verification
- **Size warnings** and integrity checking

## The Three Privacy Levels Explained

### Basic Privacy
**"They can see this right away if something happens to me"**

- **Use Case**: Emergency contacts, basic instructions, immediate needs
- **Access**: Available immediately after security questions
- **Technical**: Base64 encoding with integrity checksums and V2 markers
- **Example**: Medical information, emergency contacts

### Sensitive Privacy
**"They can see this, but only after thinking about it"**

- **Use Case**: Personal letters, family secrets, emotional content
- **Access**: Available after configurable delay (12 hours to 10 years)
- **Technical**: Base64 encoding with timestamp-based access control and V2 format
- **Example**: "To be opened 6 months after my passing"

### Ultra Privacy
**"This is for me only, never for anyone else"**

- **Use Case**: Completely private thoughts, confidential information
- **Access**: Owner only, requires master password, never shared
- **Technical**: Full AES-256 encryption with PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 key derivation
- **Example**: Private diary, therapy notes

## Enhanced Security Features

### **PBKDF2-Based Encryption**
```dart
// Enhanced key derivation with 10,000 iterations
final salt = CoreEncryptionService.generateSalt();
final key = await CoreEncryptionService.deriveKeyFromPassphrasePBKDF2(
  userPassword, 
  salt, 
  iterations: 10000
);
final encrypted = await CoreEncryptionService.encryptText(content, userPassword);
```

### **No Backdoors with Enhanced Protection**
```dart
// Ultra vaults are mathematically impossible to access without the master password
if (privacyLevel == PrivacyLevel.ultra && userType == UserType.trusted) {
  return false; // Even with PBKDF2, trusted persons cannot access
}
```

### **Precise Time Controls**
```dart
// Sensitive vaults respect owner's timing choices with per-vault granularity
if (DateTime.now().isAfter(unlockTime.add(Duration(hours: delayHours)))) {
  return true; // Time has passed, access granted
}
```

### **Enhanced Cryptographic Integrity**
```dart
// Every piece of data has multiple layers of integrity verification
final checksum = sha256.convert(utf8.encode(content)).toString();
final package = {
  'version': 2,
  'salt': base64.encode(salt),
  'checksum': checksum,
  'timestamp': DateTime.now().millisecondsSinceEpoch,
};
```

### **Performance Optimization**
```dart
// Key caching reduces PBKDF2 computation overhead
static final Map<String, Key> _keyCache = {};

// Memory management with secure cleanup
static void secureCleanup(List<int> sensitiveData) {
  for (int i = 0; i < sensitiveData.length; i++) {
    sensitiveData[i] = 0;
  }
}
```

## Building Trust in Digital Legacy

Traditional digital legacy solutions ask you to **trust them with your most sensitive information**. EchoVaults takes a different approach:

### **Trust Through Technology, Not Promises**

Instead of saying *"Trust us, we'll protect your data"*, we say:  
*"Here's exactly how we protect your data - verify it yourself."*

And now with Version 2.0: *"Here's how we've made it even more secure while keeping everything you already stored perfectly safe."*

### **Privacy as a Right, Not a Privilege**

Your privacy isn't something we grant you - it's something we **mathematically guarantee** through technology you can inspect and verify. With PBKDF2, we've made that guarantee exponentially stronger.
